                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up and constantly glued to the television, watching fashion shows and what seemed to me like the ceremonial red carpet, I took great interest in fashion. This spurred me into learning fashion designing which, in turn, paved way for my deep interest in the other areas of fashion.

I have come to the astounding belief that fashion is a way of life. It is a culture on its own. Trendy, classic, contemporary, and whatever else you need to express, fashion encapsulates all. It is a way of making bold statements. It deserves every bit of energy put into it.

I took special interest in women's fashion because not only are we expected to always look radiant, we are an exceptional set of people who should always make our marks anywhere we go.
